Description: Imbalanced training datasets impede many popular classifiers. To balance training data, a combination of oversampling minority classes and undersampling majority classes is necessary. This package implements the SCUT (SMOTE and Cluster-based Undersampling Technique) algorithm, which uses model-based clustering and synthetic oversampling to balance multiclass training datasets.
